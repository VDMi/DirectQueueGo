# DirectQueue Go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VDMi/DirectQueueGo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VDMi/DirectQueueGo)
Direct Queue worker for Drupal 8 in Go

This Go file watches the Drupal Queue and processes items as soon as it notices them or there is space in the queue.

[Drush](https://www.drush.org/) is required for getting the database connection and processing queue items.

The Drupal module [direct_queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/direct_queue) is required to process items.

## Running
Download any of the releases that matches your platform. You don't need any dependencies to run the program (besides having [Drush](https://www.drush.org/) and [direct_queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/direct_queue) inside your Drupal project). The workers can also run on a separate machine as long as the Drupal codebase, Drush and database connection are available.

You can run the program by executing it on the shell:
```
./linux_amd64_DirectQueueGo --site "/var/www/mysite.com" --uri "http://mysite.com"
```
This will start the program with the default settings. See ```./linux_amd64_DirectQueueGo help``` for the available configuration.

You can also wrap it in a upstart/init.d script, examples on that will come soon.

## Options

| --drush                | "drush"          | Path to the binary of Drush. Full path or just binary to search in $PATH. (either use console or drush, console only exists for backwards compatibility). |
| --console              | "drush"          | Path to the binary of Drush. Full path or just binary to search in $PATH. |
| --site                 | ""               | Full path to the Drupal root. |
| --uri                  | ""               | URI to pass to Drupal, useful when you are generating links. |
| --skip-queues          | ""               | Comma separated list of queues to skip, can't be used together with handle-queues. |
| --handle-queues        | ""               | Comma separated list of queues to handle, can't be used together with skip-queues. |
| --queue-workers        | ""               | Amount of workers to use per queue, format: "publish_scheduler:1,entity_update:4". |
| --default-worker-count | Amount of CPUs-1 | Default amount of workers, default value is amount of CPUs - 1. |
| --db-password          | DB Password      | Password for the database if it can't be read by Drupal Console. |
| --db-password          | "3306"           | Set the database port. |

## Compiling
Make sure you are able to run a Go 1.6 (though 1.4/1.5 should also work) environment.
```
git clone https://github.com/VDMi/DirectQueueGo.git
cd DirectQueueGo
go install
go build
./DirectQueueGo help
```

After the ```go build```, ```DirectQueueGo``` will contain the compiled binary.
You can also use ```go run``` to run the program without compiling.
